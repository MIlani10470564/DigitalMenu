1. Overview

NU CHEF is a digital menu application developed for a private chef who offers a new dining experience each evening. The app allows the chef to easily update and manage menu items so that patrons always have access to the most up-to-date offerings.

This project was created using React Native, TypeScript, and Expo.
Part 2 of the PoE focuses on building the core user interface and implementing the primary app functionality such as adding items, calculating totals, and displaying counts.
